Purpose: I found myself causing a long delay when switching from
voice mode (SSB, PTT, 500 watts) to data mode (DATA A, VOC, 50 watts)
because I had to manually turn on data mode, turn on VOX, turn off
the amplifier, and set the radio to 50 watts. The same is true for
switching back.

Macros and the Elecraft K3 Utility partially solves the problem
but not entirely since another Elecraft utility, the KXPA500, has
to also be running.  The time saving, if any, was negligible.

I have partially developed a Python program running the wxPython gui
to automate this. With the help of the Elecraft programming manuals
the task is fairly straight forward.

However, the Elecraft programming model is somewhat flawed in my opinion
in that it does not provide distinct ON and OFF commands for a number of
functions.  Most notable to me is the lack of a distinctive ON and OFF
for the VOX and PTT function and the TX Test and Normal function. They are
simply toggle functions. As a result, the rig can be in PTT or VOX when
it needs to swtich to PTT or VOX and the toggling function will cause the
rig to go into the wrong mode.

I am still working on a monitoring facility to check the PTT, VOX, TX TEST,
and NORMAL modes so the software can make the correct decision when
switching between Voice and Data.

Again the Elecraft model is somewhat flawed in that it doesn't make this
easy. I believe there is a way to directly control the radio functions
but I have as yet to discover it. And I don't think Elecraft is going to
cough it up. One fellow, now deceased, figured it out from what I
understand but I could not find his source code.

That's my story and I'm sticking to it :-) tsb 7/27/2017
